## DEBUG

# Character movement
- Pathfinding is strange
- Feedback line doesn't fit with the pathfinding (fit with the distance the character can walk)
- If character pass through another, the last one losing its tile: because tiles have only one element on it

# Border tiles
- Border tiles change position sometimes (repro needed)

# Fog of war
- Tiles in fog of war where character can move and its an enemy are displayed in red

# Camera
- recenter camera doesn't work (function is called but does nothing)

# Turns
- if you play the last character of the team order and finishes its action, it passes to the next team, even if another character can play

## REFACTOR

- Separate folders between Toy box and Technical box
- Rules / VISION section to push in C_View
- Coordinates of the covers / logic of tiles hold covers
- Fog of war in a single manager
- Separate the logic between Turns and M_Characters
- Ergonomic of characters
- Coordinates for characters (not in Move), and for covers and obstacles
- Tile class does a lot of things, fraction it (in Coordinates and a new class like Tile renderer)
- Optimization: create a variable "actionHasBeenDone" to calculate only once by turn actions with a big cost (line of sight, walkable range, etc.)
- C__Look -> fusion GetCoordinatesOfLineOfSightOn() and GetCoordinatesOfFullLineOfSightOn() together with LoS.TileInclusion
- UI with recommendations
- Tiles material work with an enum, use a Scriptable object instead
- Turns -> Victory to events
- Animator of the characters

## FEATURES

- Namespaces
- Actions systems: possibility between multiple designs
- Online API like Unity (ask Simon)
