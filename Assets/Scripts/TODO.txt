## DEBUG

# Rules

- Rules / enable fog of war doesn't work
- Modifying anything in Rules create an error

# Cover auto snap

- Border covers reinitialize often (repro needed)

# Character movement

- If character pass through another, the last one losing its tile : because tiles have only one element on it

## REFACTOR

- Rules / VISION section to push in C_View
- Auto-snap doesn't need to fit a manager, it can register itself at Start
- Coordinates of the covers / logic of tiles hold covers
