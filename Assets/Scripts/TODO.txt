## DEBUG

# Character movement
- Pathfinding is strange
    - Feedback line doesn't fit with the pathfinding (fit with the distance the character can walk)
- If character pass through another, the last one losing its tile: because tiles have only one element on it

# Border tiles
- Border tiles change position sometimes (repro needed)

# Fog of war
- Tiles in fog of war where character can move and where an enemy is are displayed in red

# Camera
- recenter camera doesn't work (function is called but does nothing)

# Turns
- if you play the last character of the team order and finishes its action, it passes to the next team, even if another character can play

# Lifebar
- restart the scene Example scene 3 teams -> when blue starts, it's an error on the life bar

## CONTENT
- Magical spells
- Drone

## REFACTOR

- Rules / VISION section to push in C_View
- Tiles material work with an enum, use a Scriptable object instead
- Cursors in Actions (not in Feedbacks)

- Feedbacks need to be independent of the manager
    - Cover state
    - Character's cover state
    - Cursor
    - View lines (what is it ? fog?)
    - Fog of war
- Unit UI
    - Health bar
    - Cover feedbacks

- Coordinates of the covers / logic of tiles hold covers -> create a new grid for elements on edges / vertex
- Fog of war in a single manager, can be enabled and disabled
- Separate the logic between Turns and M_Characters
- Ergonomic of characters
- Tile class does a lot of things: need to fraction it (in Coordinates and a new class like Tile renderer)
- UI with recommendations
- Animator of the characters
- Rename Character in Unit
- Can add and remove Actions without bugs
- Maybe use raycasts for Autosnap
- Replace Texts by TMP
- Hide/Enable tile feedback is on C__Character -> move it to M_Feedbacks

## OPTIMISATION
- Create a variable "actionHasBeenDone" to calculate only once by turn actions with a big cost (line of sight, walkable range, etc.)
- Algorithm of line of sight checking progressively the tiles around

## FEATURES

- Feedback of line of sight on visible enemies
    - Visual line of sight on hover an enemy
- Character can throw spells (like fireball)
- Separate folders between Toy box and Technical box
- Namespaces
- Actions systems: possibility between multiple designs
- Online API like Unity (ask Simon)
- Add events (FX, sound, etc.) for everything
- Multiple victory conditions
- Obstacle transparency
- Destructible obstacles
- Better enemy behaviors
- Large elements (multiple tiles)
- Missing shots can touch another tile
- Border cover can block the line of sight
- Overwatch action
- In Tactical Course project, export all the comments //BUTT to this project
- Camera rotation
- Camera actions
- Enemy spawners
- Movements with special costs or obligation to stop
- 3D grid
- Tiles of different types
- Can shoot from a step (lean)
- Armor and shield
